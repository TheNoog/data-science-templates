# Artificial Neural Networks 

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks found in the human brain. ANNs are a subset of machine learning algorithms that are designed to recognize patterns, learn from data, and make predictions or decisions.

At its core, an artificial neural network is composed of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons or "nodes." These nodes are organized into layers, typically consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node takes inputs, applies a mathematical transformation to those inputs, and produces an output that is passed to the next layer.

The connections between nodes are represented by weights. These weights determine the strength or importance of the connections between neurons. During training, the weights of the network are adjusted iteratively using an optimization algorithm, such as backpropagation, to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

The learning process of an artificial neural network involves two main phases: forward propagation and backpropagation. In forward propagation, the input data is fed into the network, and the outputs are computed through a series of calculations involving the weighted sum of inputs and an activation function applied to that sum. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

Once the forward propagation is complete, the network compares the predicted outputs with the desired outputs to compute an error. In the backpropagation phase, this error is propagated backward through the network, and the weights of the connections are adjusted in a way that reduces the error. This iterative process continues until the network reaches a state where the error is minimized, and the network has learned to produce accurate outputs for the given inputs.

Artificial Neural Networks can be used for various tasks, including regression (predicting continuous values), classification (predicting discrete labels), and pattern recognition. They have been successfully applied to a wide range of domains, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and financial forecasting.

ANNs have several advantages, including their ability to learn from large amounts of data, capture complex relationships, generalize to unseen examples, and adapt to changing environments. However, they also have some limitations, such as the need for a significant amount of training data, the potential for overfitting if not properly regularized, and the computational resources required for training and inference.

Overall, artificial neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex problems by mimicking the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. Their versatility and ability to handle diverse data make them an integral part of modern machine learning and AI systems.
