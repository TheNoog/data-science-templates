# ARIMA

ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a popular time series forecasting model used to analyze and predict data points over time. ARIMA combines the concepts of autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) to capture both the linear and temporal dependencies present in a time series.

Here's a breakdown of the components of ARIMA:

    Autoregression (AR): This component captures the relationship between an observation and a certain number of lagged observations (i.e., previous time steps). It assumes that the current value of the time series depends on its own past values. The "p" parameter in ARIMA, denoted as AR(p), represents the order of autoregression, indicating the number of lagged observations used in the model.

    Differencing (I): Time series data often exhibits trends and seasonality, which can make it non-stationary (i.e., its statistical properties change over time). Differencing is performed to transform a non-stationary time series into a stationary one by taking the difference between consecutive observations. The "d" parameter in ARIMA, denoted as I(d), represents the order of differencing, indicating the number of times differencing is applied to achieve stationarity.

    Moving Average (MA): This component considers the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. It helps capture the short-term fluctuations or noise in the time series. The "q" parameter in ARIMA, denoted as MA(q), represents the order of the moving average, indicating the number of lagged residuals used in the model.

ARIMA models are typically denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q). The values of p, d, and q are determined based on the characteristics of the time series data and are determined using techniques such as autocorrelation plots and partial autocorrelation plots.

ARIMA models can be used to forecast future values in a time series, as they leverage the information from past observations and the patterns observed within the data. They have been widely used in various domains, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and sales forecasting, among others.

It's important to note that ARIMA assumes that the underlying time series is linear and stationary. If these assumptions are not met, other models or modifications to ARIMA, such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or SARIMAX (SARIMA with exogenous variables), may be more appropriate.
