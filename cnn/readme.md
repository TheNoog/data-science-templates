# Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is primarily used for analyzing visual data such as images and videos. It is designed to automatically and adaptively learn hierarchical patterns and features from the input data.

CNNs are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The key idea behind CNNs is the use of convolutional layers, which apply filters or kernels to the input data to extract local features and capture spatial relationships. The pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions of the features, reducing their size while retaining the most important information.

The convolutional and pooling layers are typically followed by fully connected layers, which perform high-level feature extraction and classification. These layers connect every neuron to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers, allowing the network to learn complex representations and make predictions.

CNNs have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition. They are well-suited for handling large-scale visual datasets and can automatically learn and extract relevant features from the data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

Overall, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are widely used in applications where understanding and processing visual information is crucial.
