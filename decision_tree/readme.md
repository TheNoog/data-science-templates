# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a predictive modeling tool used in machine learning and data mining. It is a flowchart-like structure that represents a series of decisions and their possible consequences. The tree consists of nodes and branches, where each node represents a decision or a feature, and each branch represents an outcome or a possible value of the feature.

The decision tree starts with a single node, called the root node, which represents the initial decision or the target variable to be predicted. From the root node, the tree branches out into child nodes based on different attributes or features. Each attribute or feature is chosen based on its ability to divide the data into subsets that are more homogeneous or have similar characteristics.

The process of constructing a decision tree involves recursively splitting the data based on the selected attributes until a stopping criterion is met. The stopping criterion could be a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of data points in each leaf node, or the absence of further predictive value.

At the end of the decision tree, there are terminal nodes, also known as leaf nodes, which represent the final predicted outcomes or classifications. Each leaf node corresponds to a particular combination of attribute values and provides the predicted value or class label based on the majority of training examples that fall into that leaf node.

Decision trees are popular in machine learning due to their interpretability, as they can be easily visualized and understood by humans. They can be used for both classification tasks, where the goal is to assign data points to predefined classes or categories, and regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical features and are commonly used in various domains, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and customer relationship management.
