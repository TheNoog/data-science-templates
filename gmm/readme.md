# Gaussian Mixture Models

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that represents a complex data distribution as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. It is a parametric model that assumes the data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each with its own mean and covariance parameters.

In simpler terms, a GMM assumes that the data points in a given dataset come from multiple subpopulations or clusters, and each cluster follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution. The GMM estimates the parameters of these Gaussian distributions, such as the mean and covariance, to describe the underlying data distribution accurately.

The term "mixture" refers to the fact that each data point is assumed to be generated by selecting one of the Gaussian distributions with a certain probability or weight. The GMM learns the parameters of these Gaussian distributions and the associated weights to best fit the given data.

The process of fitting a GMM involves an iterative algorithm called the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the expectation step, the algorithm estimates the probability of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component. In the maximization step, it updates the parameters of the Gaussian components based on the estimated probabilities. The iterations continue until convergence, where the algorithm finds the best-fitting Gaussian components that describe the data distribution.

Gaussian Mixture Models have numerous applications, including image segmentation, clustering, anomaly detection, and speech recognition. They are particularly useful when dealing with data that may arise from different subpopulations or clusters, where each subpopulation can be approximately described by a Gaussian distribution.
