LASSO stands for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator." It is a linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the model's accuracy and generalization. LASSO regression adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function to encourage coefficients to be exactly zero for some features, effectively selecting only the most relevant features and shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero.

The LASSO regression objective function is defined as:

```
Loss function = RSS (Residual Sum of Squares) + λ * Σ|β_i|
```

where:
- RSS is the residual sum of squares, which measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values.
- `β_i` are the coefficients of the features (predictor variables).
- `λ` (lambda) is the regularization parameter, also known as the penalty term. It controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of lambda results in more shrinkage of the coefficients, which can lead to more feature selection (setting some coefficients to exactly zero) and simpler models.

LASSO regression can effectively perform feature selection by driving less important features' coefficients to zero. This helps to simplify the model and avoid overfitting, which can occur when a model tries to fit noise or irrelevant features. The LASSO method is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples.

The choice of the lambda value is crucial in LASSO regression. It can be determined using techniques like cross-validation or information criteria, which help to strike a balance between model simplicity and accuracy.

In summary, LASSO regression is a powerful technique that combines regularization and feature selection, making it useful for linear regression problems with high-dimensional data and when we want a more interpretable and sparse model.
