# Linear Programming


In this example, we'll consider a simple manufacturing problem where a company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The goal is to maximize the profit while satisfying certain constraints on resources and production capacities.

Let's assume the following data for the problem:

    Profit per unit of Product A: $10
    Profit per unit of Product B: $15
    Resource constraints:
        Resource 1 usage per unit of Product A: 2
        Resource 1 usage per unit of Product B: 3
        Resource 1 availability: 100
        Resource 2 usage per unit of Product A: 4
        Resource 2 usage per unit of Product B: 2
        Resource 2 availability: 80
    Production capacities:
        Maximum units of Product A: 20
        Maximum units of Product B: 30

We want to determine the number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize the total profit.
