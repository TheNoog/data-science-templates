# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical modeling technique used to understand and predict the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the dependent variable can be approximated by a linear combination of the independent variables.

In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The best-fit line is determined by estimating the coefficients or weights associated with each independent variable.

The basic form of linear regression, known as simple linear regression, involves a single independent variable and one dependent variable. The relationship between the variables is represented by the equation:

Y = β0 + β1*X + ε

where:

    Y represents the dependent variable
    X represents the independent variable
    β0 is the intercept or the value of Y when X is zero
    β1 is the slope or the change in Y for a one-unit change in X
    ε is the error term representing the deviation between the predicted and actual values

The coefficients β0 and β1 are estimated using a method called ordinary least squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared errors.

Linear regression can be extended to multiple independent variables, known as multiple linear regression, by adding additional terms to the equation:

Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βn*Xn + ε

Multiple linear regression allows for modeling more complex relationships by considering the combined effects of multiple independent variables on the dependent variable.
