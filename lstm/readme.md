An LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for learning long-term dependencies in data. RNNs are a type of neural network that can process sequence data, such as text or speech. They do this by maintaining an internal state that is updated as they process each new input. This allows them to learn the relationships between different elements in a sequence.

LSTMs are a special type of RNN that are able to learn long-term dependencies. This is because they have a special unit called a "cell" that can store information over time. The cell is made up of a number of gates, which control how information is stored and retrieved. The gates are:

* The input gate: This gate controls how much new information is added to the cell.
* The forget gate: This gate controls how much old information is removed from the cell.
* The output gate: This gate controls how much information is output from the cell.

The LSTM uses these gates to learn when to keep information in the cell, when to forget information, and when to output information. This allows it to learn long-term dependencies in data.

LSTMs are used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine translation.
