# Recurrent Neural Network

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to process sequential data. RNNs are able to learn long-term dependencies in data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as natural language processing and speech recognition.

RNNs are composed of a sequence of neurons that are connected to each other in a loop. This means that the output from each neuron is fed back into the input of the next neuron. This allows the RNN to learn the relationships between the current input and the previous inputs.

RNNs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Natural language processing: RNNs can be used to learn the relationships between words in a sentence, which can be used for tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.
* Speech recognition: RNNs can be used to learn the relationships between sounds in a spoken word, which can be used for tasks such as speech recognition and voice typing.
* Music generation: RNNs can be used to generate music by predicting the next note in a sequence.
* Financial forecasting: RNNs can be used to forecast future values of financial data by learning the relationships between past values.

RNNs are a powerful tool for processing sequential data. However, they can be difficult to train and can be prone to overfitting.
