# Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the two classes of data. The hyperplane is the line or plane that has the maximum margin between the two classes.

SVMs are a powerful tool for classification and regression tasks. However, they can be computationally expensive to train and can be sensitive to outliers.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SVMs:

Advantages:

* SVMs are very effective at classification and regression tasks.
* SVMs are able to handle a wide variety of data types.
* SVMs are relatively robust to noise.

Disadvantages:

* SVMs can be computationally expensive to train.
* SVMs can be sensitive to outliers.
* SVMs can be difficult to interpret.

## Exampl applications of SVMs:

* SVMs can be used for image classification.
* SVMs can be used for text classification.
* SVMs can be used for fraud detection.
* SVMs can be used for medical diagnosis.
* SVMs can be used for stock market prediction.
